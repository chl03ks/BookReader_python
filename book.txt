We sat quiet on the hill
Out just north of Wings Field
Waiting on the runway lights
We were wrapped in winter coats
And I said I'd drive you home
You'd been pulling out your flask all night

I wrapped my arms around the moment like I'm clutching a memory
You alive in your madness, in love with the night

The glow of the forest, the ambulance lights
The bluest things on Earth don't know shit about the blues
You used to be vibrant
You used to burn bright

[Chorus]
Put out the light
In your clouded eyes
Kept you inside
Through the summer time
Put out the fight, pressing flowers at night
In a book that you love
The pieces they can't take of us

I found you shaking at the lake
A hospital bracelet still tied to your wrist
We talked to fill the empty space
Danced on the ice until it breaks
They flooded a town so this park could exist
You see us walking on the streets in your dreams

The pills that they fed you
Your half awake eyes
The bluest things on Earth don't know shit about the blues
You used to burn...

[Chorus]
Put out the light
In your clouded eyes
Kept you inside
Through the summertime
Put out the fight, pressing flowers at night
In a book that you love
The pieces they can't take of us

[Chorus]
Put out the light
In your clouded eyes
Kept you inside
Through the summertime
Put out the fight, pressing flowers at night
In a book that you love

These pieces they can't take of us
These pieces they can't take of us
